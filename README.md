# Statistical and Machine learning models

In this project I'm trying to apply the most popular classification, regression and clustering algorithms to
sample data sets usually contained in the libraries that I'm already using.

With the purpose of getting exposure to as many models as I can to increase the scope of my ML/SL toolbox.   

### Prerequisites

To run the scripts, the easiest way is to install version 3.6 of Anaconda.
