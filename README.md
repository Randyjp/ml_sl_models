# Statistical and Machine learning models

In this project I'm exploring data by applying the most popular classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
The main goal is getting exposure to as many models as I can to increase the scope of my ML/SL toolbox.   

### Prerequisites

To run the scripts, the easiest way is to install version 3.6 of Anaconda.
